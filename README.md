This repository contains the code neede to extract coordinates from a .JSON file, to a .tps and to a .csv. However, due to the size of the raw cooridnate data, it is not in this repository, 
so the extraction code cannot be run. Equire with Dr Berta Verd if you are interested in the raw coordinates.

The Data in the data folder should allow you to run all the analysis R markdown folders
