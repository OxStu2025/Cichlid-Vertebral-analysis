Here you will find the code to complete a geometric morphometrics analysis of chcihlid species, and regionalise their vertebral columns.
The code and data used to regionalise the vertebral column can be found in the regionalsiation branch, and the morphometrics code and data is in the geometric morphometrics branch.

Ensure all the data is unzipped, and open the R project and subsequent R markdowns to run the code effectively.
