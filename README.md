This branch of the repository contains the code to regionalise the chcihlid verterbal column. The cichlids names are shortened in each Rmd title.

The data folder contains the raw tps and csv files needed for this analysis. If you would like to access the raw cooridnate data, please contact Dr Berta Verd. 

The main regionalisation markdown file contains the general regionalsiation code for all the species in this analysis, and the Rmnd for each species contains additional analysis, including caldulating
and adding error to the regions.
