Here you will find the code to complete a geometric morphometrics analysis of chcihlid species, and regionalise their vertebral columns.
One branch contains the code for performing a geometric morphometrics analysis, to analyse changes in vertebral morphology, and the other has the regionalisation code. 
The code and data used to regionalise the vertebral column can be found in the regionalsiation branch, and the morphometrics code and data is in the geometric morphometrics branch.

The Data folder in each branch contains the tps and cvs files needed to perform the analysis. If you would like to access the raw coordinate files to fully perform the tps and exv extraction and conversion, please get in touch with Dr Berta Verd. The code for the extraction is still available so you could use it for your own analysis.
